# Bible App

## Description

Bible App is a web application that allows users to explore and read the books of the King James Version (KJV) Bible. The app provides a list of all the books in the Bible, and users can select a book to read its contents. This project was created to learn and experiment with concurrent fetches and promises.

## Motivations
Experiment with promises to handle asynchronous operations effectively. Understand how concurrent promises can be used to manage multiple asynchronous tasks concurrently.

### Technical Details
This project explores the use of concurrent fetch and promises to optimize data retrieval, ensuring a more efficient and responsive application.
